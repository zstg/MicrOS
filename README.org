Create a flake.nix file that does the following:
- fetch tarballs of busybox and linux source code
- configure both. Write changes to the respective .config files located here and read from it (builtins.readFile) in flake.nix.
- in the linux kernel
  - configure initramfs support - but none of the  "Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using ..." options
  - enable printk support
  - enable TTY
  - kernel support for ELF binaries
- in busybox directory
  - install simply ash, bash, vi etc (The bare minimum possible tools for busybox)
  - compile a static binary, musl etc - no glibc.
  - use busybox sh as the init system, symlink it to the output directory.
