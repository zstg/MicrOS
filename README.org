- [X] Configure both. Write changes to the respective .config files located here and read from it (builtins.readFile) in flake.nix.
- in the linux kernel
  - configure initramfs support - but none of the  "Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using ..." options
  - enable printk support
  - enable TTY
  - kernel support for ELF binaries
- [X] in busybox directory
  - [X] install simply ash, bash, vi etc (The bare minimum possible tools for busybox)
